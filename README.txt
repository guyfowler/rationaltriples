The file section1 contains a PARI script to find all non-zero rational numbers 
which arise as the product of three singular moduli. This is referenced in 
Section 1 of the article.

/////////////////////
The file section3 contains a PARI script to find all the bounds on discriminants 
which are established in Section 3 of the article.

/////////////////////
The file section4 contains a PARI script which completes the proof of Theorem 1.2
by applying the method described in Section 4 of the article. This script finds all 
triples of discriminants satisfying one of the conditions listed at the start of 
Section 4, and then shows that for each such triple there is no corresponding triple 
of pairwise distinct singular moduli of these respective discriminants which has a 
rational product.
